This is a Ruby on Rails helper script for Redmine to copy bugs from Bugzilla to
Redmine.

The script is intended to be used in situations when bugs are moved to Redmine
selectivelly (in contrast to migrate_from_bugzilla, which is intended for
moving all tasks at once).

Helper was inspired by and is based on:

https://github.com/ralli/migrate_from_bugzilla.

== Installation ==

Copy the script to <redmine>/app/helpers.

== Features ==

* attempts to map users based on email and extern ID (LDAP)
* copies bug description and author
* copies bug comments
* does NOT copy attachments, but add comments with links to Bugzilla
* copies Bugzilla CC as watchers
* adds a comment and custom field to Redmine issue to mark the origin
* adds a comment and custom field to Bugzilla bug to mark the target
* skips bugs that were already copied

== Usage ==

IMPORTANT:
  Make sure that you create backup of Redmine database before using the helper.

1. Start Rails console

script/console production

2. Copy bugs to target project

Bugzilla.copy_to takes two parameters:
* Redmine project identifier
* Array of Bugzilla tasks to migrate

Bugzilla.copy_to "almighty-project", [3311, 3322, 3233]

The command shows verbose messages while copying migration. Tasks that were
already migrated are skipped.

3. Tips:

The following Rails queries can be useful to get the list of tasks in the
Rails console:

# Connect to Bugzilla
Bugzilla.establish_connection

# Query the product to get the id (will be shown in the output)
Bugzilla::BzProduct.find_by_name("TheBugzillaProduct")
Bugzilla::BzBug.find(:all, :conditions => ["product_id = ? and bug_status = 'NEW'", 24]).collect {|b| b.id }
